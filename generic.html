									<h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
									<p>Hello, my name is Hamza Banyhany, and I am an individual who embodies strong determination, expressive qualities, and enthusiasm. I have a deep passion for many things in life and all that it offers. </p>
								<h3>A little background about me:</h3>
								<p>I am originally from Jordan, but I was born in the Sunshine State of Florida. My cultural background is quite interesting, with Hispanic and Middle Eastern roots alongside fluency in both English and Arabic. At 20 years old, I'm just starting a new chapter, converging to shape my journey ahead. This isn't just the beginning; it's the unfolding of a narrative that intertwines my past, present, and the boundless possibilities of the future.
                                  <br>

								<h3>My Journey and Goals:</h3>
								<p>I'm a passionate Junior at FAU majoring in Computer Science for a Bachelor of Science degree, complemented by a minor in Cybersecurity. My academic journey reflects my dedication to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of technology and its security aspects. I consider myself determined and disciplined, always eager to explore new horizons.</p>
								<p>While tackling challenges fuels my determination, I thrive on problem-solving with a tenacious attitude, persisting until I uncover a solution. My enthusiasm for programming is tangible, and among the array of languages I've worked with, Python stands out as my go-to. It's not merely a skill but a testament to my commitment to mastering it.
								</p>
								<p>In addition to my proficiency in Python, I bring hands-on experience in JavaScript and React, showcasing my versatility in full-stack web development. This diversity in skill set reflects my keen interest in developing dynamic and interactive user experience programs across the entire spectrum of applications.</p>
								<p>My ultimate aspiration is to evolve into a skilled software engineer, driven by an inherent passion for developing innovative software solutions. Actively seeking opportunities in software engineering and development, I am particularly drawn to roles that allow me to contribute my skills and creativity to impactful projects. My focus extends beyond the realm of computer science; it's about making meaningful contributions to the field through hands-on development work.
								</p>
								<p>I am genuinely excited about the opportunity of continuous learning from experienced mentors and contributing my unique skills to the dynamic world of software engineering. My goal is not just to be a part of the technological landscape but to leave a significant mark through my dedication, creativity, and pursuit of excellence.</p>
